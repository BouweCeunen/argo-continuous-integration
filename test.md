# Computer Vision with Jetson Nano - Object Detection

[![DockerHub Badge](https://dockeri.co/image/bouwe/jetson-nano-vision)](https://hub.docker.com/r/bouwe/jetson-nano-vision)

All docker files rely on standard deb/zip/tbz2 files which include all necessary libraries like CUDA, CUDNN, TensorRT etc. It is possible to download these directly from the nvidia developer console. I'm using a Logitech C920 HD Pro webcam attached to my Jetson Nano for doing object detection with. I've used the Jetson Inference of dusty-nv (https://github.com/dusty-nv/jetson-inference) to make this work. The pretrained ssd_mobilenet_v2_coco model optimized for TensorRT is used. It will automatically serve the images with Flask (http://flask.pocoo.org/) on port 80 of your Jetson Nano which can then be viewed by going to the ip of that device. Resolution of the webcam is set to 1024x720. I'd advise to look at NVIDIA DeepStream for more performant detection.

```

## Run with Docker
There's a docker image of this application which can be run on your Jetson Nano device. This image has all of the Jetpack components already installed so it will work without NVIDIA JETPACK flashed onto your sd-card, this will come in handy when you would want to deploy this with Balena, as explained later.

```bash
docker run --privileged -it bouwe/jetson-nano-vision:latest
```
It is possible to set environment variables within your Docker environment. These variables are the following.

* IMAGE_OVERLAY (the detection annotation, default 'box,labels,conf')
* CAMERA_HEIGHT (width of camera footage, default 720)
* CAMERA_WIDTH (width of camera footage, default 1280)
* CAMERA (which camera source to use, default '/dev/video0')
* CONFIDENCE_TRESHOLD (confidence of detection, default 0.5)
* ALPHA_OVERLAY (alpha value of the image overlay of the detection, default 120)
* ENABLE_FLASK (enable Flask webserver, default True)

## Deploy with Balena
Create an application on Balena Cloud (https://www.balena.io/cloud/) and flash Balena OS on an sd-card and put it in the Jetson Nano. It's now possible to link a git repository with Balena.

```bash
git remote add balena <user>@git.balena-cloud.com:<user>/<application>.git
```
and execute a git push if the remote is called 'balena'.
```bash
git push balena master
```

It is possible to set aforementioned environment variables, you can also do this with Balena.

Now go to the ip of your Jetson Nano. This ip will be visible in the Balena Cloud UI.

## Building the images yourself
To proceed, login to the developer zone https://developer.nvidia.com/. Download following files, these are the dependencies and base files for NVIDIA JETPACK 4.2.2 and place them in the 'resources' folder.
